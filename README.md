## Welcome to my repository!

This course was my first step in learning Web Development. In this course I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with some other tools such as Bootstrap. I also learned to use common web dev practices such as responsive and designs. The final project of this course was to develop a website for a Chinese restaurant.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nghaffar21/coursera-test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
