## Welcome to this repository!

This course was my first step in learning Web Development. In this course I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with some other tools such as Bootstrap. I also learned to use common web dev practices such as responsive and designs. The final project of this course was to develop a website for a Chinese restaurant.
